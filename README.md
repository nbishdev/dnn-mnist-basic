# Basic Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks for comparing the effects of different activation functions as well as different number of intermediate dense layers, using the MNIST database.

We test the effect of the following set of parameters:
Activation Functions | Number of intermediate (dense) layers
:-: | :-:
`ReLU` | 5
`tanh` | 20
`Sigmoid` | 40
